# Hanged Game

**Hanged Game** is a classic word-guessing challenge where players try to uncover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time—before the drawing of the hanged figure is completed.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game to see a medieval-themed intro screen.
2. Click the **"Start Game"** button to begin.
3. A hidden word will appear as a row of underscores, with each underscore representing a letter.
4. Use the on-screen alphabet buttons—or your keyboard—to guess letters.
   * **Correct guesses** will reveal the letter(s) in their proper positions.
   * **Incorrect guesses** will trigger a new part of the hanged figure to appear.
5. **Win the Game** by guessing the entire word before the drawing is completed.
6. **Lose the Game** if the full figure is drawn before the word is guessed. In that case, the correct word will be revealed.

Good luck—and choose your letters wisely! :male_detective:
